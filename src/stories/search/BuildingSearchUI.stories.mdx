# Building a Search UI

This library contains a set of `SearchUI` components that can be used to build an integrated search interface that can fetch and filter data from a REST API.
The top-level component used to build a search UI is the `SearchUIContainer`. This component generates the state that can be shared
across the components within the container. It is also the component to which you should pass the configuration props to. These props
set global options as well as UI components like filters and columns.

## Inner Components

Any component can be included inside of a `SearchUIContainer` but there are some existing components that are designed to
consume and interact with the state generated by a `SearchUIContainer`. See the list of SearchUI-enabled components below:

- `SearchUISearchBar`
- `SearchUIFilters`
- `SearchUIDataHeader`
- `SearchUIDataTable`
- `SearchUIDataView`
- `SearchUIGrid`

See each components' page for more information.
